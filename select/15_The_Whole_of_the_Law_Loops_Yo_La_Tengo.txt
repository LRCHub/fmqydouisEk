I used to have the notion
I could swim the length of the ocean
If I knew you were waiting for me
I used to have the notion
I could swim the length of the ocean
I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you
I'd escape from my chains
And I'd reach out for you
Baby I'm in love with you
Baby baby I'm in love with you
I had to contact you
Found out I was in love with you
I had to contact
That's it
That's the law
The whole of the law
The whole of the law
The whole of the law
That' s it
That's the whole of the law
